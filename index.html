    <h1>Bithiah's Blog</h1>
  
    <p>This is my blog where I will be discussing random things! Hope you enjoy!</p>   

    <ul> <!-- q/a list -->
      <li>Who are you? Well I am Bithiah a.k.a vintagemind. </li>
      <li>Why did you choose the username <i>vintagemind </i>? Imagine being stuck in a teen body but have the mind of someone from the 1940s. Creepy...I know.</li>
      <li>What do you do? Well, I do have an actual <a href="https://vintagemind.github.io/"> portfolio</a> so if you want to know what I do, check it out! It is certainly much more "professional" as that is the purpose of a portfolio.</li>
      <li>What will you be posting about? Lots of things: economics, school, life (in general), old Hollywood, and technology.    
    </ul>
