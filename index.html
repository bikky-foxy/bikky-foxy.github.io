Six more wives of Henry VIII
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Six-Wives-Henry-VIII-Hampton/dp/B002MUR4MS"><img style="margin:5px; margin-left:25px; float:right" src="20220730-sixwives.png" height="241" width="250" alt="Picture" /></a>
For the second time in 46 years, Melody and I have sat down together to
listen to a Rick Wakeman album.
The first was <i>King Arthur,</i> on my first visit to her at her parents' house
in 1976; tonight it's the Hampton Court version of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Six-Wives-Henry-VIII-Hampton/dp/B002MUR4MS"><i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII.</i></a>
</p>
<p>
We've listened to a lot of music in between, of course, just usually not sitting side by side at home.
We were both fond of the original <i>Six Wives</i> (1972?), which, however, had flaws in the
performance and the recording, and wondered what the 2009 remake would be like.
I got hold of it, and today we listened to it together...
</p>
<p>
My impressions:  The performance and recording are first-rate.  The music is substantially changed, with three new
movements added (at least one of them composed back in the day, but not used then), 
the six wives out of historical order (I haven't delved into why), and elaboration of
the existing music.  "The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Has Ended" is still there, at the end of "Anne Boleyn,"
no longer a separate track.  The music is much more uniform from movement to movement in overall acoustic
quality, loudness, and style.  Well worth listening to!  But don't throw away your copy of the original,
which is a distinctly different work.

<i>Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, who hast given us life and sustained us
and enabled us to reach this day!</i>
</p>
<p>
Today Melody and I celebrate 40 solid years of happy marriage.
I joke that this means we have lasted 3,652 times as long
as Romeo and Juliet.
</p>
<p>
I've written a lot about what I think are the secrets of our happy marriage
(see for example <a href="../0707/anniv.html">this</a>)
and have told, in great detail, the story of how we met at a UGA recruiting
event, the friendship ripened as we wrote letters back and forth, 
and by the time Melody arrived on campus, she was the best friend I had ever had,
and from very soon afterward, my inseparable companion.
</p>
<p class="red">
Melody was the first friend who understood what I was doing with my time, energy,
and life &mdash; why I got such enjoyment from learning things that were not
job training or commercial entertainment.  I had gotten tired of people admiring my intellectual pursuits by saying,
"That's amazing, I could never do that."  Melody had <a href="../2104/index.html#x210429">wide interests of her own</a>
and knew that she <i>could</i> do anything she put her mind to.  Nothing that I cared about
was a completely closed box to her, and vice versa.  She <i>understood.</i>
</p>
<p>
What I can add is that we both feel as if we were together, in spirit, in some way
for a couple of years before we actually met.  That is, we were becoming more and
more alike, and seeing more clearly what the ideal companion would be like &mdash;
and then we met.  Life and God had been preparing us for each other.
</p>
<p>
Forty years are not long enough!  Let's go for forty centuries!

This is a stack of forty (yes, forty) 2-minute exposures through my Celestron 8 EdgeHD
at f/7 with an H-alpha-modified Nikon D5500.

News update

<p>
Sharon and I have just returned from North Carolina, where, for the first time, she was
examined by a research-level physician, who pinpointed the cause of her shoulder pain in a
way that had not been done before.  It is probably going to be treated surgically.
She has three disorders overlaid on each other, one of which has already been treated
successfully, and there's a good chance that in five years she'll be substantially better.

The Ring Nebula and a galaxy <br/>
<small>First light with the new Losmandy GM811G</small>
</p>
<p>
After three weeks of cloudy weather, I've finally had my new Losmandy telescope mount
out twice, once for a visual session and once to take pictures, last night.
I'm still confirming basic functionality and not yet attempting anything challenging.
Here's a stack of 16 2-minute exposures of the Ring Nebula (M57) with my
Celestron 8 EdgeHD at f/7 and Nikon D5500 (H-alpha modified):
</p>
<p>
<img src="20220716-M57-16x2m-cropped-dark.jpg" height="500" width="500" alt="Picture" />
</p>
<p>
To the upper right of the nebula, you can see a faint smudge, which is the distant galaxy IC 1296.
Here's the same picture, processed lighter, to make it easier to see the galaxy:

</p>
<p>
One thing that fascinates me about the astrophotography I'm doing these days is that almost
every picture shows background galaxies, some of them very poorly known to science.
Amateur astronomers of my era think of galaxies as a couple of hundred reasonably bright objects
we can see with our telescopes.  No &mdash; as the James Webb Space Telescope has demonstrated,
the universe is <i>full</i> of them!

My father's 1950s stapler

<p>
While tidying up my desk the other day, I found the stapler that had been on my father's
desk since the 1950s (I distinctly remember handling it in 1960), got it out, and put it
on my own desk.  It's surprising how well it works.
</p>
<p>
The piece of black tape on it dates from the 1970s.  I can't remember if it is covering
up a rusty spot, or if I just needed a place to put down a piece of tape for a moment,
then forgot about it and didn't come back for it.  My Facebook audience has actually
debated whether I should leave it on.  It's like leaving an 18th-century bookplate in a
16th-century book; it's part of history, though not the same history.

The missing university
</p>
<p class="red"><small>[Revised.]</small></p>
<p>
Today, taking advantage of post-COVID conditions, I spent a couple of hours taking a long walk
on the UGA campus (all the way from the Georgia Center parking deck to the Arch, and then downtown
to Wuxtry Records to buy used CDs), and on the way back, paused in the Main Library.
</p>
<p>
It reinforced my impression that <b>there are almost no regularly enrolled summer-term students here.</b>
There were groups of incoming students at orientation, with their leaders, but very few people who
looked like regularly enrolled students.  What happened?
</p>
<p>
What I've found out is that <b>online courses are displacing classroom courses,</b> at least during
the summer.  There's plenty of enrollment, but it's for online instruction.
</p>
<p>
I have mixed feelings about that.  Since the 1960s (yes, 1960s!) there has been speculation that
classrooms would be superseded by instruction through the Internet or, earlier, TV.
But it didn't happen.
</p>
<p>
Is COVID what it took to get people to stop wanting to gather for the college experience?
And if so, is that a good thing?
</p>
<p>
I can see how online courses can be a big money-saver &mdash; you can stay at home.
And some courses (mostly introductory ones, and drill-and-practice language courses) would
come through very well.  Others, though, might benefit from more personal contact.
And some courses require hands-on experience in labs.
</p>
<p>
And more to the point, what about the experience of meeting people and learning to
communicate with them?  Have young people suddenly lost their gregariousness?
And education spreads from person to person &mdash; maybe a third of what I learned in my Ph.D.
studies came laterally, from student to student!
</p>
<p>
What I think is that online instruction will continue to siphon off <i>part</i> of the student
body at any given time.  It will slow down or reverse the growth of the resident-student
population without making the University go away.  It will give students a way of peeling away
part of the cost, not having to be resident for four full years.
</p>
<p>
In the future I can imagine a different scenario.
Let the students <i>gather</i> at library/lab/study facilities near them
(which junior colleges could turn into) but <i>study</i> online at any university
that will take them.
The local facility could offer the companionship of like-minded students, at
least within some limits, and maybe some hands-on laboratory courses.
Major in physics at MIT while living in Georgia and
spending part of your days on the campus of Gainesville College,
maybe putting in one or two semesters of actual residence at MIT before getting the degree.
I'm not sure if I would like that kind of college experience, but it would certainly make
a good education more affordable.
</p>
<p>
If that's too much of a stretch, imagine a reasonably major university <i>hosting</i> online
students at other universities, and maybe allowing them to take some lab courses locally
and work with some local faculty members.
That could be a real paradigm shift.
</p>
<p class="red">
Either way, online instruction may finally <b>do for us what junior colleges promised
and did not quite achieve</b> &mdash; make <i>part</i> of a major university education
much more affordable &mdash; because the online courses are offered by the major university
itself and have its full backing and prestige; you don't have to worry if they will be
accepted for transfer credit.

In compliance with <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm">U.S. FTC guidelines</a>,
I am glad to point out that unless explicitly
indicated, I do not receive substantial payments, free merchandise, or other remuneration
for reviewing or mentioning products on this web site.
Any remuneration valued at more than about $10 will always be mentioned here,
and in any case my writing about products and dealers is always truthful.
<br /><br />
Reviewed
products are usually things I purchased for my own use, or occasionally items
lent to me briefly by manufacturers and described as such.
<br /><br />
I am no longer an Amazon Associate, and links to Amazon
no longer pay me a commission for purchases,
even if they still have my code in them.
